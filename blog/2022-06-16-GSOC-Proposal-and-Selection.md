If you would have asked me a couple of months ago, if I would you be interested in applying for GSOC, let alone get selected, I would have said NO, becasue I never thought of myself to be such a good coder to contribute to open source. But here we are. All of that happened. I applied to GSOC for a project named **" Self Adaptive Controllers for Path Following"** mentored by the organisation **"Robocomp"** and got selected to work on it.


This entire process started when a friend suggested that I should give it a shot considering the project is right up my alley given my research work is on the similar line. So I decided to check it out and thought indeed that it was very close to the work I did and so decided to try. I installed the framework, contacted the mentors and discussed some ideas. Mentors suggested that I should write and submit the proposal because my idea was a good one. I have to be honest, I gave up a couple times becasue I thought I could not do it , but in the end with support from friends, I did end up submitting the proposal, mere hours before the deadline. To my surprise I got selected. Now onto the real work. I am excited for the project and importantly to contribute to open-source which I am doing for the first time. Usually I am on this side of the table, where I just use open source software. 

So now I have to work on this controller and hopefully it is useful to someone, just as I am thankful to the legends who open sourced all the software I use for my work, from ROS to PX4-Autopilot source code.
