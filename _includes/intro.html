          Hey! I am a second-year PhD student in <a href = "https://mrs.fel.cvut.cz/" target = "_blank">Multi-Robot Systems Group (MRS)</a> at the Czech Technical University advised by <a href = "https://mrs.fel.cvut.cz/members/professors/penicka" target = "_blank">Dr. Robert Pěnička</a> and <a href = "https://mrs.fel.cvut.cz/members/martin-saska" target = "_blank">Prof. Martin Saska</a>. My research focuses on using learning-based methods for generalisable, multi-goal, and multi-task agile UAV flight. In the long term, I aim to develop a unified controller that can operate <em> safely at high speeds in cluttered, real-world outdoor environments. </em>>
      <br>
      Before my PhD, I worked on classical nonlinear control strategies for UAVs carrying different types of payloads, such as suspended loads and aerial manipulators at <a href = "https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/" target = "_blank">RRC, IIIT-H</a> advised by <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/spandanroy" target = "_blank">Dr. Spandan Roy</a> ,  <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ok1eCzUAAAAJ&hl=en" target = "_blank">Prof. Simone Baldi</a> and <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FJkKPJ4AAAAJ&hl=en" target = "_blank">Dr. Jinoh Lee</a>.  
      <br>
      <br>

At MRS, I have the opportunity to work with an exceptional team that regularly deploys UAVs in outdoor, real-world conditions. <a href = "https://mrs.fel.cvut.cz/projects" target = "_blank">Here</a> is a glimpse into what our group does. 
          <br>
          <br>
I am also a trained Kuchipudi dancer. I hold a diploma and am a Doordarshan B-grade artist, which makes me eligible to perform at cultural events organized by the Government of India, both within the country and abroad. Some of my performances can be seen <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3gsKJMXGyiwjCp9PmfrnKg" target = "_blank">here</a>.
         <br>
          <br>
I am currently interested in a research stay of about 4 to 6 months and would be happy to explore collaborations on learning-based planners or controllers for UAV flight. Please feel free to get in touch if our research interests align!
