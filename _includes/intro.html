          Hey! I am a second year PhD student at Multi-Robot Systems Group (MRS) in Czech Technical University advised by Dr. Robert Penicka and Prof. Martin Saska. My current research interests revolve around leveraging the power of learning based methods for generalisable, multi-goal and multi-task agile flight. Long term, I would like to arrive at a unified controller able to operate at super high speeds in cluttered environments in outdoor, real world scenarios! 
          <!-- I am currently a master's student at Robotics Research Center, IIITH advised by <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/spandanroy" target = "_blank">Dr. Spandan Roy</a> with collaboration with <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ok1eCzUAAAAJ&hl=en" target = "_blank">Prof. Simone Baldi</a> and <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FJkKPJ4AAAAJ&hl=en" target = "_blank">Dr. Jinoh Lee</a>. -->

      <!-- I am currently working applied non-linear control theory for robotic systems. Videos of my projects are seen <a href = "https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL20mrdU_b4UMqnWqdo9QIqkZGjL12jd51" target = "_blank">here</a>. My research intrests lie in safety critical control and sim2real especially pertaining learning based controls. I am currenty seeking a PhD position in control theorty for robotics commencing Fall 2023, please feel free to contact me if I'm a good fit to your lab. My CV could be found <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L43mJ_RjC0aP0wk1wVXfbPKNY3f1CGSd/view" target = "_blank">here</a>. -->
      Prior to this I worked on classical non-linear control methods for UAV flight aimed at a carrying a payload via different mechanisms such as suspended payload and an aerial manipulator at RRC, IIIT-H advised by Dr. Spandan Roy,  Prof. Simone Baldi and Dr. Jinoh Lee.

      <!-- I am also a Kuchipudi Classical Dancer and performed all across India. I have a diploma and a guinness world record in Kuchipudi dancing. Some of my performances can be seen <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3gsKJMXGyiwjCp9PmfrnKg" target = "_blank">here</a>. -->
I have the fortune and privilege of working with UAVs in outdoor settings with an incredible group of people at MRS. A peek into the workings of the group here. 

I am also a trained Kuchipudi Dancer. I hold a Diploma and I am a Doordarshan B-grade artist (FYI, this certification makes you eligible to perform at events held by the Indian government, both in India and abroad. Grades are assigned based on age category).
          <br>
          <br>
I am currently looking for a research stay for a duration of around 4-6 months. If you think we could collaborate on leaning based planners and/or controllers for UAV flight, please feel free to contact me!
